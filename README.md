# speech_enhancement
This project is based on the Paper "Speech Enhancement Using a Risk Estimation Approach" by Jishnu Sadasivan, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula, Nagarjuna Reddy Muraka. 
The project deals with multiple perceptually relevant distortion measures for speech enhancement. These distortion measures show better performance than MSE in multiple SNR conditions.
